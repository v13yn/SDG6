            <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color=White aria-setsize="20">SDG Goal 6, Clean Water and Sanitation aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Water and sanitation are critical to the health of people and the planet. Goal 6 not only addresses the issues relating to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), but also the quality and sustainability of water resources worldwide. Improvements in drinking water, sanitation and hygiene are essential for progress in other areas of development too, such as nutrition, education, health and gender equality.</font></p>

        <h2><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="white">Purpose of "WASH": The core activity of WASH emphasizes the teaching of basic sanitation and hygiene to communities and school children with a particular focus on girls' education and gender equality, as a necessary complement to the success of water and sanitation infrastructure projects.</font></h2>

            <p><font color="white" face="Trebuchet MS">Millions of people die every year from diseases associated with unsafe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene. Young children are particularly vulnerable – WASH-related diseases remain among the leading causes of death in children under 5, and they contribute to malnutrition and stunting. Each year, 300,000 children under 5 die due to diarrhoea linked to inadequate WASH. Despite significant progress, 2.2 billion people worldwide do not have safely managed drinking water services. Over half the global population, 4.2 billion people, lack safely managed sanitation services.</font></p>

            <h2><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="white"><a id="why">Why do we need clean water and sanitation?</a></h2>
                <p>Unsafe water causes water-borne illnesses such as Escherichia coli-induced diarrhea, cholera, typhoid fever, giardia, Hepatitis A, and dysentery. Communities need clean water to stay physically healthy and prevent diseases caused by a lack of adequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH).</a></font></p>

                <h2><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="white"><a id="takeaction">What we can do to help?</a></font></h2>
            <ul type=Circle marker="white"><font color="white" face="Trebuchet MS">
                <li>Find a Goal 6 charity you want to support. Any donation, big or small, can make a difference!
                    <li>Run a campaign on hygiene. Raise awareness about the hygiene issues in your community through social media, school/university campaign or even a campaign in the neighborhood you live in.
                        <li>Organize a clean up project for rivers and oceans. Engage your whole community to clean up a local river, seaside or an ocean.
                            <li>4 billion people lack access to basic sanitation services. Lend your voice to talk about the lack of toilets in many communities around the world!
                            <li>Don’t overuse water. Make sure to close a tap when washing dishes, take short showers – Bathtubs require gallons more water than a 5-10 minute shower. Consider getting a water meter to be aware of your water usage.</li></font></ul>
